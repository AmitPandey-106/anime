        <h2>The City: A Character in Itself</h2>
        <p>
          From the moment you step into the city, you feel suffocated by its oppressive atmosphere. The sky is perpetually 
          grey, and rain pours down almost every day, creating an almost claustrophobic environment. The air is thick with 
          humidity and a sense of despair. The city feels rotten to the core — filled with grime, filth, and people who 
          seem to have given up on life. The architecture is bleak, with dilapidated buildings and flickering street lights 
          casting ominous shadows everywhere. You can smell the wet asphalt, hear the distant wail of sirens, and feel the 
          tension as if something terrible is always about to happen.

        <h2>The Investigation Begins: Gluttony</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine walking into the first crime scene. The smell hits you immediately — a sickly mixture of rotting food 
          and human waste. Its a dimly lit, run-down apartment. The victim, an obese man, is found face-down in a plate of 
          spaghetti, his body bloated and grotesque. Its clear hes been forced to eat until his stomach ruptured. The 
          killer has left a message, Gluttony, written in grease behind the refrigerator. The room is stifling, the air 
          heavy with the stench of decay and death. You can feel the weight of the killers sick game bearing down on you, 
          and Somerset knows this is only the beginning.

        <h2>The Discovery of Greed</h2>
        <p>
          Next, you are led to the scene of a powerful defense attorney murder. His office is stark and sterile, with cold 
          marble floors and large, imposing windows. His body lies in front of a scale, with a pound of his own flesh cut 
          from his side. Greed is written in blood across a stack of legal documents. The room feels eerily quiet, the 
          only sound the soft hum of fluorescent lights. The stark contrast between the opulence of the victims life and 
          the brutality of his death leaves you with a profound sense of horror. You can almost hear the killers voice in 
          your head, mocking the greed of society.

        <h2>Sloth: A Living Nightmare</h2>
        <p>
          This scene is perhaps the most disturbing. As you walk into the apartment, you immediately notice the oppressive 
          heat and smell of rot. The room is cluttered, with old newspapers, food containers, and filth. The victim is a 
          skeletal man, who has been strapped to a bed for a year, kept alive but tortured to the brink of death. Hes 
          barely recognizable as human anymore, his skin pale and covered in sores. Sloth is scrawled above the bed. The 
          mans shallow breathing is the only sign that hes alive. You feel an overwhelming sense of horror and pity as 
          you realize hes been tortured for so long, left as a shell of a person. Its a scene that makes your skin crawl, 
          the air so thick with the stench of death that it clings to your clothes as you leave.

        <h2>Lust: The Brothel</h2>
        <p>
          Now you find yourself in a seedy, dimly lit underground brothel. The neon lights flicker, casting a sickly red 
          glow across the room. The victim, a prostitute, has been brutally murdered with a knife-like contraption strapped 
          to her client. Its a grotesque and horrifying crime, clearly intended to punish the sin of Lust. The room 
          reeks of sweat, fear, and shame. You feel the discomfort of the detectives as they interrogate the shaken and 
          terrified client, who was forced to commit the murder under the threat of his own death. The atmosphere is heavy 
          with guilt and disgust. Every breath you take feels contaminated by the moral degradation around you.

        <h2>Pride: The Beauty Queen</h2>
        <p>
          The next crime scene is pristine in comparison. A high-end apartment, immaculately clean and stylish. The victim, 
          a former model, lies dead on her bed, her face disfigured by self-inflicted wounds. The killer had given her a 
          choice — live disfigured or die. She chose death. Pride is written in lipstick on the wall. The room is eerily 
          quiet, almost peaceful, but the grotesque nature of the crime taints the tranquility. You feel a strange sense of 
          sadness here, knowing that the killer preyed on the victims vanity, using it as a weapon against her. The 
          contrast between the clean, almost sterile surroundings and the horror of what has transpired is deeply 
          unsettling.

        <h2>The Final Sin: Wrath and Envy</h2>
        <p>
          The investigation leads to the killer, John Doe, who turns himself in, covered in blood. You feel a sense of 
          disbelief — why would he surrender now? The truth is even more disturbing. John Doe leads Somerset and Mills to 
          a remote desert location for the final two sins: Wrath and Envy. As you stand in the heat of the barren landscape, 
          you feel the tension mounting. A delivery van arrives, and Somerset opens a box containing Mills wife severed 
          head. John Doe reveals that he was envious of Mills life, completing the sin of Envy. Mills, overcome with 
          rage, becomes Wrath as he executes Doe in a fit of fury, despite Somersets desperate attempts to stop him.
